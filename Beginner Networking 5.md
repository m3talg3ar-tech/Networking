### Learning Objectives
1. **OSI Layer 5: Session**
   - Understand that OSI Layer 5 is responsible for session management.
   - Learn how ports and sockets function within this layer.

2. **Ports and Sockets in Layer 5**
   - Ports are used to identify specific processes on a computer or server.
   - Sockets allow communication between different devices over the network by combining an IP address with a port number.

3. **OSI Layer 6: Presentation**
   - Recognize that OSI Layer 6 handles data presentation and encryption.
   - Understand SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for secure communications.

4. **SSL in Layer 6**
   - Learn about the role of SSL in establishing a secure connection between client and server.
   - Know how SSL ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication during transmission.

5. **OSI Layer 7: Application**
   - Identify key application layer services such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

6. **Application Services in Layer 7**
   - Understand the functions of each service:
     - **SMTP**: Used for sending and receiving emails.
     - **FTP**: Facilitates file transfers between computers on a network.
     - **DNS**: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
     - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols used to transfer data over the web.

### Practical Tips
7. **Wireshark Configuration**
   - When using Wireshark for packet analysis, right-click on a TCP packet and choose "Protocol Preferences."
   - Uncheck "Relative Sequence Numbers" in Protocol Preferences settings (Note: This tip is specific to certain versions of Wireshark).

### HTTPS Overview
8. **HTTPS Basics**
   - Understand that HTTPS uses port 443 for secure communication.
   - Recognize that it was first introduced with HTTP/1.1 and defined in RFC 2616.

9. **Establishing an SSL Connection (HTTPS)**
   - Learn about the initial steps of establishing a secure connection:
     - A quick handshake between client and server to verify identities.
     - Agreement on encryption protocols for data security.
